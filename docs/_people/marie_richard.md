# Brief Biography

I still remember the most terrifying day of my life. It was in February and the
nice hoomans took me on a super long car ride. When we got to my new forever
home I met my big brother. He was much bigger than me and played really rough.
Eventually over time my big brother got smaller and I started beating him when
we played.

I never really helped my hooman with research. I was too busy practicing bite
face. When my papa started working from the office again, I didn't notice 
because that was during my nap time.

# My Current Research

Creating the most obnoxious smell I can by rolling in poop and dead animal
carcasses.
