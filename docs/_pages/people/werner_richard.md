# Brief Biography

One fine May day, during something my hooman calls the pandemic, I went for a
car ride. It was a long car ride, like a bazillion years (edit from my hooman:
it was only an hour). After the car ride I arrived at my forever home. Settling
in to my new life was hard. I had an important job: to keep my hooman comapny 
during the pandemic. In exchange, my hooman gave me lots of treats, foods, and
adventures. 

Eventually I started doing research. When my hooman was coding I would help 
push keys he didn't. I was good. Then we got another hooman. I helped her with
her research too. It was hard to do research for two hoomans so we got me a
helper. She wasn't good at research. She just wanted to play bite face all day. 
I spent a lot of time trying to make her good at research, so much that
I stopped helping my hoomans. Eventually papa stopped working from
home. That was okay, because then I could concentrate on helping mama with 
research. I still get to help my papa on weekends. When he do too much research
we hold mandatory scrum meeting at park.

Pawing turtles to see if they will play with me.
