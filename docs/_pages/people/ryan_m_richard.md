# Brief Biography

I grew up around Cleveland, Ohio. As a kid I spent most of my time playing
video games, which fueled my interest in technology, electronics, and software. 
When I started as an undergraduate at Cleveland State University I was 
initially a bio major, because I loved animals, but ended up quickly switching 
to chemistry on account of growing tired of memorizing taxonomy. During 
undergraduate research in my second year, I was exposed to computational
chemistry. The fact that, in theory, all of chemistry could be predicted by 
solving one equation (the Schrodinger equation) was intoxicating and my career
path was largely set. I was going to get computers to do chemistry for me.

For graduate school I attended *The* Ohio State University. It was at this point
I began to really understand electronic structure theory and learned  how to 
program. This was the second time I became intoxicated with an idea. As I began
to understand computer software design, I realized coding in theoretical
chemistry doesn't have to be as hard as it is often portrayed. With some
pre-emptive planning, it is possible to have user-friendly interfaces *AND*
code that performs well.

My two postdocs, first at Georgia Tech, and then at Ames National Laboratory
(then called Ames Laboratory), strengthened the skills I had acquired as a
graduate student. My work on the NWChemEx project ultimately resulted in me 
becoming a staff scientist at Ames National Laboratory and an adjunct 
professor of chemistry at Iowa State University.

# My Current Research

At the moment my main role is the chief architect and lead developer of 
NWChemEx. This takes up roughly 80% of my research time. The remaining 20%
is focused on developing and applying GhostFragment. 

# Hobbies (*i.e.*, the 20% of my day that's not research or sleep)

My dogs. Repairing my house (particularly after my dogs destroy it). Video 
games. Working out.
