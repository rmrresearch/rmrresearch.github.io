This website is under heavy construction at the moment.
{: .notice--warning}

We are very interested in growing and have opportunities for undergraduate,
graduate, and post doctoral researchers. We also are always looking for 
additional synergistic collaborations. Please feel free to 
[reach out](mailto:rrichard@ameslab.gov) if you are interested.

Welcome to the Richard Group homepage! Use the links below to learn more about
the group members and our research. This site also serves as resource for
current group members (or I guess really anyone with internet access) and
contains a number of tutorials and resources that have been useful in our
day to day workflows.
