## Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI)

Ames National Laboratory is one of 17 Department of Energy (DOE) National
Laboratories which participates in the
[SULI](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli) program. The SULI program is a PAID
internship which partners scientists at DOE with undergraduates majoring in
STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields in order to develop
the student's research skills while contributing to actual state-of-the-art
research.
